# Race Tracker UI Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Date: November 10, 2024

## Problem Statement

The Race Tracker application had several critical UI and navigation issues:

1. **Missing Elements on Overview Page**: After creating a race, the overview page at `/race-maintenance/overview?raceId=X` was missing key elements and showing "0 Total Runners"
2. **Navigation Lock Issues**: Users were unable to exit operations or switch between modes after creating a race
3. **No Clear Mode Switching**: There was no clear button or mechanism to change between different operation modes
4. **Poor User Experience**: Users felt trapped after creating a race with no clear path forward
